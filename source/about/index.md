Are you looking for an experienced professional developer and/or architect to help you develop your .NET website or app? Or are you looking for a coach or lead developer to help your team to get organized and/or develop new skills? Does your team need guidance implementing DevOps or improving their development process in Team Foundation Server? Then I might be the person you are looking for.

I will work with you to create your website or app, using proven Agile techniques, so you will be in control of the result at every step of the way. I will use my 7+ years of experience working as a consultant at different companies in the Dutch Healthcare system to deliver your wishes, on time and as a high quality product. A product that is developed based on the requirements, is stable, secure, tested, documented, ready to be deployed and expandable in the future.
As a developer I have experience in developing full stack applications .NET (C#), ASP.NET (MVC or Winforms), WCF/WebAPI, LINQ using Microsoft SQL Server or Azure storage solutions. Even though my strengths are on the backend, optimizing performance and designing maintainable code, I can develop Javascript (for example with JQuery) and can implement a responsive design without any problem.

As an architect I designed complex, fast and secure multi-tier systems, using patterns like SOA (Service-oriented Architecture), CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and EDA (Event-driven architecture). These systems have been deployed in private infrastructures or in the (Azure) cloud.

As a consultant I helped streamline and professionalize development processes by introducing Agile, Scrum, Continuous delivery and/or DevOps. For example, by fully utilizing Team Foundation Server or tools like Octopus Deploy.

I am a Dutch citizen, currently based in Lima, Peru. Most work will be remote, but anyone in Lima I can meet or work for on location. I speak basic Spanish, but work related discussions will (for now) need to be in English or Dutch. I have no problem flying out to you if this is required for a project.

Feel free to contact me to discuss if I can help you with your specific needs.
